# Survival Guide for Online Teaching

This guide is being created for teachers at [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/)
to deliver excellent masterclasses.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a set of 10 recipes used by teachers at Data Science Retreat to successfully create and deliver online lessons on Data Sciene and related topics.

## Target Audience

The recipes are to be used by experts who will deliver short online courses in the field of Data Science. The experts have plenty of industry experience but little experience in teaching. The audience will be 8-15 career changers with mixed backgrounds participating in a bootcamp.

## Recipe Structure

Each recipe is an illustrated guide of 1-2 pages with the structure:

1. What problem does the recipe solve?
2. How to solve the problem step-by-step?
3. Where to find more information / background info?

The recipes should heavily favor illustrations over text, so that they are easy to read and apply for busy people.
The documents will be prepared as SVG images and Markdown text so that it can be deployed in multiple forms, including infographics, blog posts, social media campaigns and PDF.
