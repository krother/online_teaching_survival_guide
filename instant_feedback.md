## The Problem

You have **no idea** what is going on in your class.

.. or worse, you **know** something is going on:

## Solution

Select one strategy:

### A: Single Choice Quiz

Asking 3 questions on the subjects from the last lesson is a low-risk strategy:

also works as a True/False quiz

You learn how much into the subject your students are.

### B: Collect ideas

Collect ideas in an online app

Let students see the results:

good to let off some pressure in a controlled manner.
